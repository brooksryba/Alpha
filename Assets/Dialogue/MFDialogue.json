Growing up my mom always told me stories of his skills and bravery. I've always wanted to be one ever since, it also just feels natural to use a bow. What about you MF?","\n","^AF: What about you MF?!","\n","^MF: Oh, ugh, sorry about that. I was reading about this cool spell. What was the question again?","\n","^Hero: How do you know what your combat affinity will be?","\n","^MF: I've always enjoyed reading and learning spells. I think it's part of my nature. Why do you ask?","\n","^Hero: The affinity test is tomorrow and I'm worried because there isn't just one combat style that feels right to me. My grandma tells me that my dad was a warrior and my mom was a mage. She even said my grandpa was an amazing archer. I've tried the different styles and I'm OK with each but I'm not sure which one is the right one for me.","\n","^AF: Don't worry about it too much. The whole point of the affinity stone is to let the person know which combat style they will accel at.","\n","^MF: She's right. They say the stone is able to look into a person's soul and discover their inner attributes. As far as I know it hasn't been wrong about anyone.","\n","^Hero: I'm sure you guys are right. Regardless of what I get, I'll embrace it.","\n","^AF: Look over there.
