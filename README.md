Tablets of Arkala is a turn-based RPG about making friends. You pick your own class in the beginning. This class will determine which stats are likely to increase as you level up. The townsfolk who you befriend will be able to join your party and offer unique abilities and benefits. The game will feature an element based system where different types of attacks will affect different types of defenses, i.e. some elemental attacks will be weaker or stronger against certain defensive elements.
